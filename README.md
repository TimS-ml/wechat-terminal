# wechat-terminal
A terminal wechat based on itchat, for my personal use.

Wechat is a disgusting app but I can't get rid of it.

I hate GUI, I hate to be distracted by notifications 'Moments', 'Mini Programs' and 'Official Accounts', I hate to install useless features on my phone that I don't care about and I don't need. All those useless stuff will run in the background of my android phone, draining my battery life and memory.

Debian netinst CD image: 150-300 MB
Wechat 7.0.22 apk: 172 MB
